# Emotion Echo 🎧🙂

Emotion Echo is a multimodal AI system that detects human emotions using
facial expressions and voice signals, and responds intelligently using
agentic AI and large language models.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Face emotion detection (computer vision)
- Voice emotion detection (audio + speech features)
- Multimodal emotion fusion
- Intelligent AI response generation
- Modular, scalable system design

## 🧠 Tech Stack (Planned)
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- ML/DL: PyTorch, OpenCV, Transformers
- LLMs & Agents: LangChain / Agentic AI
- Deployment: Docker (later)

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `frontend/` – Web UI
- `backend/` – API services
- `ml/` – ML & DL models
- `deployment/` – Docker & infra
- `docs/` – Documentation
- `tests/` – Testing
- `scripts/` – Utilities

## 🎯 Goal
Build an end-to-end, real-world AI system suitable for hackathons,
research, and ML engineer portfolios.
